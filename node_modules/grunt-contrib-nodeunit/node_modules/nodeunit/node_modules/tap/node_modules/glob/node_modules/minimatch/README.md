# minimatch

A minimal matching utility.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)


This is the matching library used internally by npm.

Eventually, it will replace the C binding in node-glob.

It works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`
objects.

## Usage

```javascript
var minimatch = require("minimatch")

minimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!
minimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!
minimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!
```

## Features

Supports these glob features:

* Brace Expansion
* Extended glob matching
* "Globstar" `**` matching

See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`

## Minimatch Class

Create a minimatch object by instanting the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.

```javascript
var Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch
var mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)
```

### Properties

* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.
* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.
* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.
  Each row in the
  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row
  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern
  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:

        [ [ a, d ]
        , [ b, c, d ] ]

    If a portion of the pattern doesn't have any "magic" in it
    (that is, it's something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it
    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular
    expression.

* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression
  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish
  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.
* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.
* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.
* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.

### Methods

* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.
  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.
* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or
  false otherwise.
* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split
  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This
  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be
  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.

All other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.

## Functions

The top-level exported function has a `cache` property, which is an LRU
cache set to store 100 items.  So, calling these methods repeatedly
with the same pattern and options will use the same Minimatch object,
saving the cost of parsing it multiple times.

### minimatch(path, pattern, options)

Main export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.

```javascript
var isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })
```

### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)

Returns a function that tests its
supplied argument, suitable
